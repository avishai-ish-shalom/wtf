# WTF

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/avishai-ish-shalom/wtf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/avishai-ish-shalom/wtf)

Ever SSHd into a server and wondered wtf is this server doing? if so, `wtf` is the tool for you!

`wtf` is a CLI tool for quickly gaining context about what a server is doing, who/what it belongs to and what (obvious) problems does it have.
Think of it as sort of an emergency button you can press anytime to get important information fast.

Current status: still prototyping. Don't use it yet.
